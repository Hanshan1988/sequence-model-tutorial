# sequence-model-tutorial
This contains a series of notebooks taking the audience through from the basics of deep learning in terms of usage with Tensorflow and Pytorch through to basic sequence models and finally to state of the art transformers and their variants. The focus would be on explaining the hard topics in simple and user-friendly ways through diagrams and code.
